Printing of "RichText" with DELPHI 2, 3 and 4.


The printing of  "Richtext" (RTF) textual documents is not well supported by Borland in the, as a part of Delphi delivered,
RichEdit component.
The adjusting of paper margins, text of the title, page numbers, border lines, logo of a firm and print preview is missing.
In order to lift these shortcomings I have written a special non-visible RichPrinter component.
Every type of font in every colour, size and style can everywhere be printed on the page with the aid of the component.
Further there can be placed a bitmap logo everywhere on the paper page.
On a printer preview can been shown on screen how the pages will look as they will be printed on paper.


I have not found the time yet to make help pages as a companion of the component;
but in the included Word document "RichPrint component explanation" the working is explained. 
The components are rather simple to use and therefore the usability of help-pages is limited.


The component has three important functions:
a.  Adjusting printing pages margins, orientation and paper format,
b.  Print preview,
c.  Printing the RichText to the printer

The RichPrint component supports both the normal RichEdit component and the RichEditEx component (text + embedded graphic).


The component is free for use (free ware) in non-commercial applications, 
that is any software that is not being sold in one or another way.
