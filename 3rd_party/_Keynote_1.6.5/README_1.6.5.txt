The file "history.txt" is the most important file to look at,
especially if you are upgrading from a previous version.
New users can also find this file helpful, as it contains
detailed information about *all* KeyNote features added since
the program was first released.

The file "bugs.txt" contains a list of known bugs and limitations
of the program. Windows NT and Windows 2000/ME users: you MUST
read this file!

"sample.knt" - this file is opened automatically when you
start KeyNote for the first time. It contains many tips,
features, keyboard shortcuts, and showcases some of KeyNote's
capabilities. DO NOT USE THIS FILE FOR PERSONAL NOTES! It will
be overwritten when you upgrade Keynote to a new version.

All these and several other files are located in the
"\DOC" subdirectory, below the directory where you
installed KeyNote. Please browse through these files
before you send a bug report or a support question.
Thank you!

FURTHER INFORMATION:

There are two mailing lists which you can subscribe to,
to keep up with the latest news about KeyNote and other
freeware programs I wrote. One is an announcement-only
list (note more than 2 messages a month; information
about major upgrades and additions). The other is an
unmoderated discussion list. To subscribe to either list,
please go to the General Frenetics Freeware website:

and click the "Mailing lists" link.

IMPORTANT FOR USERS UPGRADING VERSION EARLIER THAN 0.90

As of version 0.90, KeyNote supports two major new features:
encrypting the KeyNote files and creating Tree-type notes.
These features are incompatible with any previous release
of KeyNote. Therefore, encrypted files or files which contain
Tree-type notes cannot be opened using any version of KeyNote
earlier than 0.90. However, any file that does NOT use these
features will be automatically saved in a format that is
compatible with earlier releases of KeyNote.

SOURCE CODE:

KeyNote is an open-source program, distributed under Mozilla Public
License (MPL). You can download full KeyNote source code from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/keynote/
(Borland Delphi 3.0 required to compile. You may need to install some third-party components, some of which are included in the distribution.)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Please see file "acknowledgments.txt" for a list of third-party
components without which I would certainly not have been able
to take KeyNote as far as it is today.

NOTES:
Please do NOT send HTML-formatted email to any of the
addresses above. All HTML-formatted email will be
bounced to sender. It will NOT be read or answered.

Please do NOT send any irrelevant attachments (.vcf cards,
graphic backgrounds, "winmail.dat" files, etc). Attachments
are OK if they are directly relevant to a program you are
contacting me about: for instance, if you are reporting a bug,
you are welcome to attach a screenshot where the bug is apparent
(but please send GIF or JPG images only, no bitmaps unless they
are compressed!).

PGP signatures are welcome.

Please do not request that files be sent to you via email.
I have a rather slow and metered connection. Since all the
software I offer for downloading is free, I would really
like to avoid any additional costs. Whatever is available
can be downloaded directly from the website.

Thank you.
