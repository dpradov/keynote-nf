  AddrLookup - Post-mortem address analyzer
  Usage: AddrLookup <mapfile> <baseaddr> <erroraddr>

    <mapfile>   : Path to .MAP file (generated with Detailed mode)
    <baseaddr>  : Module base address (hex, without $)
    <erroraddr> : Exception address (hex, without $)

  Example: AddrLookup MyApp.map 880000 D35D1E

* Based on JCL: JEDI Code Library (https://github.com/project-jedi/jcl)

It allows you to locate the method and line that generated an exception if the executable did not contain specific code for it
(for example, using JCL) but you do have the associated .map file (in verbose mode) for the corresponding executable.

The base address can be displayed alongside the error message (E.Message), which already includes the error address, using, for example:

   function GetImageBaseAddress: Pointer;
   begin
     // -> Obtain the actual base address of the EXE loaded by the operating system during the specific execution (with ASLR applied).  
     Result := Pointer(HInstance);
   end;

 E: TException;
 MsgTxt:= Format('[%s] %s (Base Addr:%p)', [E.ClassName, E.Message, GetImageBaseAddress]);
